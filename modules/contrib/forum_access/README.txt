INTRODUCTION
------------

This module changes your forum administration page to allow you to set forums
private. You can control what user roles can view, edit, delete, and post to
each forum. You can also give each forum a list of users who have administrative
access on that forum (AKA moderators).

 * For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
   https://www.drupal.org/project/forum_access

 * To submit bug reports and feature suggestions, or to track changes:

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.


PERMISSIONS
-----------

Administering Forum Access requires Core's Administer Forums permission.
Detailed explanations of how Forum Access' grants work together with Core's
other permissions are available on the administration pages.


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install the Forum Access module as you would normally install a contributed
   Drupal module. Visit
   https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

    1. Navigate to Administration > Extend and enable the module.
    2. Rebuild the permissions.
    3. Forum Access does not have its own administration page. Navigate to
       Administration > Structure > Forums > Edit/Add Forum/Container for
       the controls. Save.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Step-by-step troubleshooting instructions are provided on the administration
pages.

In case you have additional node access modules enabled, the administration
pages will provide additional information on how to make them work together,
and you should probably follow the troubleshooting instructions to install
DNA and learn about how your combination of node access modules works.
